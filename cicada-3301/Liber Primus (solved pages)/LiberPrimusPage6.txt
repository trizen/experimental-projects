IT IS THROUGH THIS PILGRIMAGE THAT WE SHAPE OURSELVES AND OUR REALITIES

JOURNEY DEEP WITHIN AND YOU WILL ARRIVE OUTSIDE

LIKE THE INSTAR, IT IS ONLY THROUGH GOING WITHIN THAT WE MAY EMERGE

WISDOM

YOU ARE A BEING UNTO YOURSELF

YOU ARE A LAW UNTO YOURSELF

EACH INTELLIGENCE IS HOLY

FOR ALL THAT LIVES IS HOLY

AN INSTRUCTION COMMAND YOUR OWN SELF
