# Generate the entire sequence of both-truncatable primes in a given base.

# Optimization:
#   there are far fewer right-truncatable primes than are left-truncatable primes,
#   so we can generate only the RTPs and then check which ones are also LTPs.

# Maximum value for each base is given in the following OEIS sequence:
#   https://oeis.org/A323137

# Total number of primes that are both left-truncatable and right-truncatable in base n:
#   https://oeis.org/A323390
